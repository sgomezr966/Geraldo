How to build Geraldo the SensorShip

Per robot:
 1   PyBoard
 1   breadboard
 2   continuous rotation servos (BotBrain.com)
 3   IR line follower sensors (Keyes, Xinda or similar)
 2   3-color (RGB) LED modules (Keyes, Xinda or similar)
 1   4 x AA battery pack (or other 6 VDC supply)
 4   AA batteries

The current design uses only a single IR line follower sensor.
However, at least two on-line designs show three being used.
This text describes only the current design with a single line
follower.

* For each servo, connect the three pins of the servo to the
  (GND VIN X1) and (GND VIN X2) pins of the PyBoard.

* Connect the battery pack negative (-) lead to GND pin of the IR
  sensor and GND pin of the PyBoard. (Use the breadboard to split the
  path in two.)

* Connect the battery pack positive (+) lead to VCC (or +) pin of the
  IR sensor and the VIN pin of the PyBoard. (Use the breadboard to
  split the path in two.)

* Connect the remaining pin (OUT or S) of the IR sensor to the X5 pin
  of the PyBoard.

* Connect the Blue (B) pin of the 3-color LED to the Y4 pin of the
  PyBoard.

* Connect the Red (R) pin of the 3-color LED to the Y6 pin of the
  PyBoard.

* Connect the negative (-) pin of the 3-color LED to GND of the PyBoard.

* Each IR line follower sensor has a "potentiometer" a.k.a. "pot"
  a.k.a. "variable resistor" which can be rotated with a small
  screwdriver. This, together with the distance of the sensor from the
  surface being "sensed", determines the sensitivity of the sensor,
  and will probably require a bit of trial and error adjustment of
  both the height and pot, in finding the best tracking setup.
